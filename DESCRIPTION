Description: Implements Marginalized Zero-Inflated Poisson (MZIP) and 
    Marginalized Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (MZINB) models. 
    Unlike standard zero-inflated models (e.g., `pscl::zeroinfl`) which 
    interpret coefficients conditional on the latent state, this package 
    models the marginal mean directly, simplifying the interpretation of 
    population-level effects. Estimation uses a stabilized two-stage 
    optimization approach (Nelder-Mead refinement followed by BFGS) and 
    provides robust sandwich variance estimators.
