\description{
A processed subset of data derived from the study "Crime during the transition to
adulthood" (Courtney & Cusick, 2010). This dataset is used to demonstrate
the Marginalized Zero-Inflated Model (MZIM) and has undergone specific
preprocessing steps including variable selection and listwise deletion.
}
\details{
This dataset was created by subsetting the original data to focus on specific demographic
and outcome variables. Preprocessing steps included:
\itemize{
\item Selection of relevant variables (\code{GENDER}, \code{INSCHOOL_W1}, \code{ABUSESUM_W1}).
\item Recoding of missing values (e.g., -9 codes converted to NA).
\item Listwise deletion of observations with missing data in the selected variables.
\item Renaming columns for clarity in model demonstration.
